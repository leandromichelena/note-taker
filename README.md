# note-taker
Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 11. This application uses an Express.js back-end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The front-end was provided by the University of Toronto, through the Trilogy Education Services. I created the back-end and connected it to the front-end.

## About This Repository
This repository contains the working files for the Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 11. <br>
The objective of this exercise is to apply the concepts learned during the module 11 Express.js. The application runs on Node.js and was deployed to Heroku. It is a simple page that reads and writes notes in an array format to a JSON file. The API and HTML routes were created using Express.js. The Insomnia app was used for testing the routes during the development stage.
